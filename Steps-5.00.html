<div><div>Increase Hospital Beds with Targeted MRI and CT Scanner Expansion</div><div><br></div><div>Objective</div><div><br></div><div>To enhance hospital capacity and reduce patient wait times by increasing the number of hospital beds in conjunction with targeted expansions in MRI Units and CT Scanners.</div><div><br></div><div>Analysis</div><div>Positive Insight: Locations that increased hospital beds by over <font color="#00ff00"><b>15%</b></font> while also boosting MRI and CT Scanner numbers saw a reduction in the predicted hospital stay duration by up to<font color="#00ff00"><b> 0.5</b></font> days. This indicates a direct correlation between resource availability and efficiency in patient care.<br><br></div><div><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1459/7/3.jpg" style="width: 75%;"><br><br>Negative Insight: In contrast, locations with increased hospital beds but without proportional increases in MRI and CT Scanner capacities did not show significant improvements in hospital stay durations, highlighting the importance of balanced resource allocation.<br><br><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1459/7/4.jpg" style="width: 75%;"><br><br><div>ROI Calculation</div><div><br></div><div>Enhancing hospital capacity by adding beds and appropriately increasing MRI and CT scanning capabilities can lead to more efficient patient management. Assuming an additional capacity of 500 patients annually with an average stay cost saving of $1,500 per patient, the potential saving is<b> <font color="#00ff00">$750,000</font></b> annually. The investment required for additional beds and equipment could yield a positive ROI within 4 to 5 years, considering the cost of hospital bed expansion and additional MRI and CT units.<br><br><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1459/7/5.jpg" style="width: 75%;"><br></div></div></div>
