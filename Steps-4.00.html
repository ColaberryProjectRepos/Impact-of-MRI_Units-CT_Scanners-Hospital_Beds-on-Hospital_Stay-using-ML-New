<div><div>Optimize MRI Units and CT Scanners Allocation</div><div><br></div><div>Objective</div><div><br></div><div>To reduce the average duration of hospital stays by optimizing the allocation of MRI Units and CT Scanners, leading to improved patient throughput and increased hospital capacity.</div><div><br></div><div>Analysis</div><div>Positive Insight: An increase in MRI Units by over <font color="#00ff00"><b>15%</b></font> year-over-year is associated with a reduction in the actual hospital stay duration by up to<font color="#397b21"> </font><b style=""><font color="#00ff00">0.5</font></b><font color="#6ba54a">&nbsp;</font>days in some locations. This suggests that better availability of MRI services can lead to faster diagnosis and treatment plans.</div><div><br><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1459/6/1.jpg" style="width: 75%;"><br></div></div><div><div><div><div><br></div><div>Negative Insight: Locations with a slower increase in CT Scanners (below <font color="#ff0000"><b>5%</b></font> YoY) have shown a less significant decrease in hospital stay durations, indicating that inadequate growth in CT scanning capacity may hinder potential improvements in patient management efficiency.<br><br><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1459/6/2.jpg" style="width: 75%;"></div><div><br></div><div><div>ROI Calculation</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Assuming an average daily cost for hospital stay is $1,500, reducing the average stay by <font color="#00ff00"><b>0.5</b> </font>days across 1000 patients annually can save up to <font color="#00ff00"><b>$750,000</b></font>. Investing in additional MRI units, with an average cost of $2 million per unit, can break even in approximately 2.7 years, not accounting for additional revenue generated from increased patient capacity.<br></div><div><br><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1459/6/3.jpg" style="width: 75%;"></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div></div></div></div>
